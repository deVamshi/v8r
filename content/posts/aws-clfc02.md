### Suggestions:
- Opt for an offline test center to avoid common online issues like power and network failures.
- Consider yourself well-prepared only when consistently scoring 80%+ in practice tests.
- Apply your learning practically by thinking about how AWS services can fit into your specific use case.

### Note:
I should mention that I had prior exposure to AWS, which likely aided my preparation. Take the time you need.
