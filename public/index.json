Gotta avoid junk food as much as possible and start eating heart healthy food. Also, I’m planning to become a vegan. I got this thought after reading this book named How Not To Die , What I learnt is that, we get literally nothing from having non-veg, there are a lot of side-effects from it. Replacing it with plant based diet is one of the best decision one can make. So yeah, I will try to be mindful about my diet. Also, Regarding the gym, I was going on and off throughout this year. In total, I would say, 3 months of my times is spent in the gym. I could have been more consistent than what i have been but yes. So regarding this, I will first do some home workout with resistance bands and if i feel like i can continue, then i will think of joining a gym again. Apart from gym going, I will go for walk on a daily basis. This should be consistent, no excuses. For the diet part, I will be having more fruits. Health insurance is provided by my company so that’s a plus. 2. money: After saving enough for my emergency fund, I focused more on mutual funds mainly the index funds. Stock market isn’t for me, I don’t really like the idea of tracking numbers and patterns. It’s hard to keep up with the latest news, so i will delegate it to the fund managers and just focus on increasing the income sources so i can invest more. In the initial stages of one’s life, Increasing the income will have more effect than trying to invest more. Cause without much income, we can’t invest more. I got this from the “Just keep buying book”. One of the best book on personal finance. Since my goal is higher income, I will look if i can get a better role or a better job somewhere else. Will also focus on passive income, be it from in app purchases or freelance work. 3. career/work: Currently i don’t like the role, so will try to get a better role from within the same project or switch to a new project or in the worst case change to a different company altogether in case i don’t get an ideal role Will be focusing more on getting certified for cloud. More time will be used for practicing leetcode. I’m learning more by building stuff. Will try to focus on just creating projects with spring in specific. Also, My focus would be on learning Java Spring, Cloud and Micro-services and build stuff using it. Sharing thoughts on linkedin will also be of focus to me this year. Be it writing articles on this blog and share the one’s that matter on linkedin. 4. family \u0026amp; friends: Try to keep people in touch as I usually neglect this part. At least call them when time permits. I would also want to focus on travel this year. At least go somewhere every weekend. Be it nearby or plan for more adventurous stuff like hiking. Plan for any hackathons/meets to build connections. Be kind and help others in need. 5. self: I need to get into meditation more. Be consistent with reading \u0026amp; Journaling. Take things slow. I feel like, compared to my peers, I take life a bit too seriously. So, want to change that. By taking time out and going places. Try to become more independent. Explore alone when possible. Will be keeping track of these goals and reviewing them on a weekly basis. Like they say, Keep goals specific. With that, Happy New Year! and let\u0026rsquo;s try to make this year a \u0026ldquo;one to remember\u0026rdquo; kind.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/changes-for-2024/","summary":"what i\u0026rsquo;m planning for 2024","title":"changes for ‘24"},{"content":"thoughts on being in a relationship i would say, it’s not for everyone. like before we get into a relationship, it’s important to be aware of the tradeoffs and then decide if it is worth the shot.\ntradeoffs: you will have to spend time talking/texting, going out on weekends if you are the type of person who is introverted and love to spend time being home, read some books, then it’s going to be a problem. some people are dramatic, they want all your time to be spent on them, making them laugh, happy or whatever but if it is at the expense of the time that you would otherwise use to invest in your personal growth then you will be the one at loss. cause time is everything. that’s the only factor that determines where you will end up.\nespecially in our 20’s, this is the time that decides where we will end up later on. the college that we get into, our first job, all these things get decided based on the decisions that we take in this period.\nmost of the relationships during this time don’t last. as they say, we should be prepared for the worst case scenario, so let’s just say you spent all your time on this girl, instead of balancing the study time for 2 years and you end up in a tier 3 college where it’s pretty hard to get placed, and during such worst times what if she leaves you? 2 years down the drain. if it works out fine, what’s the guarantee that you will get married to this girl? considering your future prospects like your college and job? abysmal.\nthere’s always scope for a heart break it could be due to reasons that are outside of your control, maybe she might find someone more interesting than you, cooler than you, good looking than you. If she leaves you for such reasons, consider it a bullet dodged. Cause in most cases people who does these things are not mature enough. Cause it’s just stupid, in the long run they don’t matter.\nit’s not just time that is wasted. our mental peace, people go into depression in some cases and they might never recover back.\nbut trust me, no matter how logical you want to think about it, it\u0026rsquo;s going to really hard, seeing your girl with someone else.\nWhat could happen if you say no to a relationship? We might feel lonely and think “What’s the point of having all these if we don’t a person to share with?” and i won’t deny that, it feels lonely sometimes, you get a job and have no one to celebrate with.\nOf course we will have our parents and friends but it’s quite different from having that one girl who laughs for your stupid jokes.\nBut as I said, it depends. It’s about priorities. It’s quite hard to have everything without any tradeoffs. Nothing comes easy. You want it, You pay the price. I envy those who always balance things pretty well. I wish i could do that. But that’s not me. I’m more of all or nothing breed. I can’t focus on multiple things.\nwe should also consider the fact that this is not going to be forever, we will get married, obviously the arranged one but still we do have a chance to find the one.\nin summary: anyways these are my thoughts on relationship stuff. i have been in few relationships. went through some pretty tough heart breaks. sometimes they dumped me and other times i did. either way, it’s just an experience and a necessary one to have. there’s a lot we can learn from getting our hearts broken, cause no matter how hard you may try to stay away from such things, someone someday will break it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/thoughts-on-relations/","summary":"thoughts on being in a relationship","title":"relationships"},{"content":"tldr: Name: Vamshidhar Telugu\nProfession: Software Developer, Solutions Architect\nCertifications: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\nExperience: 2 Years\nSkills: Go, Flutter, Java, AWS, Microservices\nLocation: Bangalore, India\nProjects: Jott, Less, Civic-Issues\nLinks: github linkedin\nA little about me: My name is vamshidhar and I\u0026rsquo;m an indie developer focused on creating minimalistic productivity apps.\nExperience: Tata Consultancy Services (2023 - Present) ZeroPay (2021 - 2023) Skills: Golang AWS Flutter Java Certifications: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Projects: Less Jott Civic Issues ZeroPay ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","summary":"tldr: Name: Vamshidhar Telugu\nProfession: Software Developer, Solutions Architect\nCertifications: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\nExperience: 2 Years\nSkills: Go, Flutter, Java, AWS, Microservices\nLocation: Bangalore, India\nProjects: Jott, Less, Civic-Issues\nLinks: github linkedin\nA little about me: My name is vamshidhar and I\u0026rsquo;m an indie developer focused on creating minimalistic productivity apps.\nExperience: Tata Consultancy Services (2023 - Present) ZeroPay (2021 - 2023) Skills: Golang AWS Flutter Java Certifications: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Projects: Less Jott Civic Issues ZeroPay ","title":"About Me"}]
