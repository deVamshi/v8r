  "articleBody": "Here are few things that will be in focus for the upcoming year.\n1. health: I got my full body checkup done this year and it turns out, My body needs my help. Gotta avoid junk food as much as possible and start eating heart healthy food. Also, I’m planning to become a vegan. I got this thought after reading this book named How Not To Die , What I learnt is that, we get literally nothing from having non-veg, there are a lot of side-effects from it. Replacing it with plant based diet is one of the best decision one can make. So yeah, I will try to be mindful about my diet. Also, Regarding the gym, I was going on and off throughout this year. In total, I would say, 3 months of my times is spent in the gym. I could have been more consistent than what i have been but yes. So regarding this, I will first do some home workout with resistance bands and if i feel like i can continue, then i will think of joining a gym again. Apart from gym going, I will go for walk on a daily basis. This should be consistent, no excuses. For the diet part, I will be having more fruits. Health insurance is provided by my company so that’s a plus. 2. money: After saving enough for my emergency fund, I focused more on mutual funds mainly the index funds. Stock market isn’t for me, I don’t really like the idea of tracking numbers and patterns. It’s hard to keep up with the latest news, so i will delegate it to the fund managers and just focus on increasing the income sources so i can invest more. In the initial stages of one’s life, Increasing the income will have more effect than trying to invest more. Cause without much income, we can’t invest more. I got this from the “Just keep buying book”. One of the best book on personal finance. Since my goal is higher income, I will look if i can get a better role or a better job somewhere else. Will also focus on passive income, be it from in app purchases or freelance work. 3. career/work: Currently i don’t like the role, so will try to get a better role from within the same project or switch to a new project or in the worst case change to a different company altogether in case i don’t get an ideal role Will be focusing more on getting certified for cloud. More time will be used for practicing leetcode. I’m learning more by building stuff. Will try to focus on just creating projects with spring in specific. Also, My focus would be on learning Java Spring, Cloud and Micro-services and build stuff using it. Sharing thoughts on linkedin will also be of focus to me this year. Be it writing articles on this blog and share the one’s that matter on linkedin. 4. family \u0026 friends: Try to keep people in touch as I usually neglect this part. At least call them when time permits. I would also want to focus on travel this year. At least go somewhere every weekend. Be it nearby or plan for more adventurous stuff like hiking. Plan for any hackathons/meets to build connections. Be kind and help others in need. 5. self: I need to get into meditation more. Be consistent with reading \u0026 Journaling. Take things slow. I feel like, compared to my peers, I take life a bit too seriously. So, want to change that. By taking time out and going places. Try to become more independent. Explore alone when possible. Will be keeping track of these goals and reviewing them on a weekly basis. Like they say, Keep goals specific. With that, Happy New Year! and let’s try to make this year a “one to remember” kind.\n",
